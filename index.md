## Programming

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    puts("Hello World!");
}
```

I've been ~~programming~~ since I was around 8 years old, but I wouldn't call it programming - more like copying and pasting Visual Basic scripts and seeing what happened when I changed things. I only started to understand what I was doing after I read a book about python in 5th grade.

I really started to enjoy programming when I realized I could use it to make games. I started with Java, and a few years later, I branched out to C/C++ to use OpenGl.

I've played around with a bunch of languages since I started programming, but I tend to use only a handful of them on a daily basis.
